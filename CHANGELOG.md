This is the initial public release of the Comecero Data Exporter application. Data Exporter is new and untested. Hence the reason for a pre-1.0 release. It has not been in use in a production environment for quite some time, but this 'pre-1.0' release represents the public, open source release of the project, including an MIT license.
